# Cognitive Landscapes of Language: Investigating Polysemy Representation in English, German, and Multilingual BERT Models


The human brain's linguistic and cognitive abilities have enabled remarkable communication and survival mechanisms. This paper investigates the phenomenon of polysemy—words with multiple meanings—within English and German using monolingual and multilingual BERT models. By analyzing embeddings for polysemous words, we seek to understand the interaction of language, cognition, and computational modeling.
